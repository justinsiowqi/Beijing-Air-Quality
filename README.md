# Beijing Air Quality

## Overview

* This project is Codecademy's "Intermediate Machine Learning Skill Path" Final Portfolio.
* Goal: Test different Machine Learning models and use the selected model to predict the concentration of PM2.5 in the coming years.
* Data: The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data) contains information regarding hourly air pollutants from 12 air-quality monitoring sites in Beijing from 1st March 2013 to 28th February 2017.
* Analysis: K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest were used to predict PM2.5 concentrations. The models were then evaluated using r^2 score, mean absolute error and mean squared error.
